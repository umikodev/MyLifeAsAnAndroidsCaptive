    "I wake up in a panic, unable to breathe."
    "Where am I?!"
    "I look around."
    "Oh, right, I'm in Hareka's apartment..."
    "I take a few deep breaths to calm down."
    "It's okay, I'm okay..."

    "Hareka is sleeping soundly on the floor."
    "I stand up, careful not to accidentally step on her, and head to the desk where her laptop is."
    "I boot it up, and the login screen greets me."
    "{b}Доброе утро! Кто пользователь?\n{i}(Translation: Good morning! Who is the user?){/i}{/b}"
    "Huh, Russian? Is Hareka Russian?"
    "No matter. I don't have much time."
    "I type in her name."
    "{b}Добро пожаловать, Харека! Пожалуйста, введите свой пароль.\n{i}(Translation: Welcome, Hareka! Please enter your password.){/i}{/b}"
    "Shit. It's password protected."
    "I understand this is a Government device, and the security will be high. I can't risk getting caught this early on."
    "I shut down the laptop and sit back on the bed, sighing in defeat."
    "Just then..."
    hareka "Mmm..."
    "She begins to stir."
