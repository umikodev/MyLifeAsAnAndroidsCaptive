    "I take a few deep breaths to calm down."
    "It's okay, I'm okay..."

    "Huh, Russian? Is Hareka Russian?"
    "No matter. I don't have much time."
    "I type in her name."

    "Shit. It's password protected."
    "I understand this is a Government device, and the security will be high. I can't risk getting caught this early on."

    "She begins to stir."
