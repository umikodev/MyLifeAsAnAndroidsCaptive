# My Life As An Android's Captive
My Life As An Android's Captive, or MLA3C for short, is a romance and sci-fi visual novel. You play as Alex Moore, who wakes up one day having been kidnapped by the Government. She has to try and escape without getting caught for her shady practices. Your choices determine your fate!

This game used to be "Crimson Love (Redux)" but I am trying to revive it by giving it a different name and continuing my development unattached to the original project.
